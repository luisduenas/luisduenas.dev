Hello world!! :raised_hands: 

This is my first post on my brand new Gatsby blog! :purple_heart:

I'll be writing about any random thing that comes to my mind (Mostly programming stuff).

But first, let me talk a little about myself...

My name is **Luis Duenas**, I'm a software developer :muscle: from Mexico.

I have 2 dogs :dog:, ~~a cat~~ three cats :cat2::cat2::cat2: and a beautiful wife :couple_with_heart: who also is a software developer!

I like a lot to dig in github and find some projects to contribute in my spare time.

I love to cook, I was a chef for 7 years before I became a developer.


Things I like:
- Minimalistic designs :star:
- Code optimization :rocket:
- Automation :computer:

I also like reading a lot of blog post about programming, productivity, and inspirational.
